sudoku
======

Sudoku solver. Pass it any unfinished sudoku board, and it will solve it.   
Finished, but the code is far from perfect. It may or may not work after the class ends because it has library dependencies from Umass. Depending on the complexity of the board, it will take a long time.    
I have the files to make it work, but have not needed to put them in this repo (I do not know how to create my own libraries yet)
