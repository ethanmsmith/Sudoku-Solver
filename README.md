sudoku
======

sudoku coded in scala for cs220 @umass so I can work between osx and win8.
Finished, but the code is far from perfect. It may or may not work after the class ends because it has library dependencies from Umass.
I have the files to make it work, but have not needed to put them in this repo (I do not know how to create my own libraries yet)
